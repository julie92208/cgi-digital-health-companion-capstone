# Digital Health Companion – ITBA Capstone Project

This repository showcases my IT Business Analysis capstone project at Conestoga College: a **Digital Health Companion (DHC)** solution proposal for **CGI**.

The project simulates a real client engagement where our team acts as business analysts and solution designers. We analyze the current state, define business requirements, evaluate solution options, design the database and architecture, and build a roadmap for implementation.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Client:** CGI (simulated case)
- **Industry:** Digital Health / Healthcare Technology  
- **Role:** Project Manager / Business Analyst / Solution Designer  
- **Goal:** Design a consumer-facing **Digital Health Companion app** that helps users manage medications, vitals, and appointments, while enabling CGI to expand into the B2B2C digital health market.

**Key questions addressed:**

- How can CGI reduce dependency on government contracts and enter the private digital health market?
- What business requirements and KPIs define success for this initiative?
- Which solution option (build, partner, do-nothing) creates the strongest ROI over 5–20 years?
- How should data, integrations (FHIR/HL7), and security be designed?
